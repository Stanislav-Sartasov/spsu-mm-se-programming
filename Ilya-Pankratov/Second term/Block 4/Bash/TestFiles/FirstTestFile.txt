Reflective programming is a mechanism that lets a process introspective capabilities.
The reflection APIs built into programming languages allow you to inspect code at runtime.
You can use this ability to learn about the surrounding codebase and its contents.

Reflection’s often talked about in the context of object-oriented programming.
You often use reflection to discover codebase entities at runtime.
The language’s reflection API will let you inspect classes, methods, properties, and types
from within your system. This lets you build more dynamic functionality.

Systems which utilize reflection are able to interrogate and modify their own environments.
This is where reflection differs from plain value introspection. A language with full
reflection support will permit codebase modification at runtime, effectively allowing the
source to rewrite aspects of itself.
